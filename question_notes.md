# Question notes

## [1768_merge_strings_alternately](questions/1768_merge_strings_alternately.py)

Pretty straight forward. There is a slightly worse option (two pointers), but no better solution listed on leet code. 

Interestingly, leetcode doesn't consider the input strings or output string in the memory complexity

## [1071_greatest_common_divisor_of_strings](questions/1071_greatest_common_divisor_of_strings.py)]

No huge notes. I don't think I could have arrived at the math proof on my own, but it makes sense (and might be recognizable). 

Time to implement (31 minutes) is a little long, and implementation could have been cleaner.
