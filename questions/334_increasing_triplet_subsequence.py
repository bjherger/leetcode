Given an integer array nums, return true if there exists a triple of indices (i, j, k) such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]. If no such indices exists, return false.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Any triplet where i < j < k is valid.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: false
Explanation: No triplet exists.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,1,5,0,4,6]
Output: true
Explanation: One of the valid triplet is (1, 4, 5), because nums[1] == 1 < nums[4] == 4 < nums[5] == 6.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10**5
-2**31 <= nums[i] <= 2**31 - 1
 

Follow up: Could you implement a solution that runs in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity?
 
Questions
 - Finite length: Yes
   - Technically, max length is contsant, so brute forcing would be O(1)?
 - Number range: -231 to 231
 - Multiple valid triples
   - Doesn't matter. Don't need to return triplet, just if at least one exists
 - Ties?
   - Doesn't strictly meet < condition

Options
 - Option 1: Brute force. Check every set of 3, starting at index 0. 
   - T: O(N^3), S: O(1)
   - Optimization: Break once one is found
   - Likely recursive shaped, w/ starting index, second index passed in, base case to see if remaining indexes are valid
 - Option 2: Sorted Array
   - Sort array by value, save index of value Work through, and check if there are greater indices to the right
   - Sort: O(nlgn)
   - Pass to check O(n)
   - T: O(nlgn), S: O(n)
   - Can we do better? Sorting may not be required. To do better, we'd likely have to be O(n)
 - Option 3: ... some sort of min heap / tree structure?
 - Option 4: Just keep track of smallest and secon dsmallest seen so far.

Proceeding w/ Option 2
